This is the source code of a project I completed in one of my classes.

This program is a memory allocator. The program allocates blocks of memory and frees the blocks when they are no longer needed.
The program uses linked lists and arrays to manage the different blocks of memory.

This malloc implementation is similar to that of the implementation that C uses.
