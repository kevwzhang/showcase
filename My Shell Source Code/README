This folder contains the different files I used to create my own working shell from scratch.

When run, this program works pretty much like C Shell. It can take inputs and run commands the same way C Shell executes commands.

NOTE: Not all features I intended to implement were implemented. Some commands that exist in C shell have not been implemented. However everything works smoothly and all implemented commands can be executed successfully.
