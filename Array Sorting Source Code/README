Array Sorting Algorithms by Kevin Weiyi Zhang

This program sorts an array using various sorting algorithms
This was created to demonstrate my understanding of these algorithms

Use the following commands to run the program:
Type in 'newRandomArray' and press enter to generate an unsorted array of ints
Type in 'print' and press enter to print the array
Type in 'selectionSort' OR 'insertionSort' OR 'mergeSort' and press enter to sort the array
Type in 'quit' and press enter to quit the program

example list of commands:
newRandomArray
print
selectionSort
print
newRandomArray
print
insertionSort
print
newRandomArray
print
mergeSort
print
quit
